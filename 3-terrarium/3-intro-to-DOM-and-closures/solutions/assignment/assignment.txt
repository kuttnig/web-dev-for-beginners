For this task I chose the "Document" interface. The "Document" interface represents
any webpage loaded into the browser and serves as an entry point into the webpages
content (DOM-Tree).
A commonly used method of this interface would be: document.getElementById(<name : string>).
This method returns the element with the id which was passed as an argument to the function. 
Element is the base class from which all element objects in a Document inherit. Element inherits its
properties from its parent interface "Node". For more information please refer to:

Document: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document
Element: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element
Node: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node


For my example I chose the website "w3schools.com". If we inspect the landing page, we find a "path" element:
<path id="wavepath" d="M0,0  L110,0C35,150 35,0 0,100z" fill="green" style="fill: red;"></path>
(these elements are generic elements which are used to define shapes). On of its attributes is "id" which is currently set
to "wavepath".
Within the HTML-Document is some JS (embedded in the <script> tag). A function is defined which is called "setThemeMode". This
function is used to style the page appropriate if dark/light theme is selected by the user. Function: 

function setThemeMode() {
  var x = localStorage.getItem("preferredmode");
  var y = localStorage.getItem("preferredpagemode");  
  if (x == "dark") {
    document.body.className += " darktheme";
    document.getElementById("radio_darkcode").checked = true;
    
  }
  if (y == "dark") {
    document.body.className += " darkpagetheme";
    document.getElementById("wavepath").style.fill = "rgb(13,23,33)";
    document.getElementById("radio_darkpage").checked = true;
    
  }
}

We can see that first variables x and y are retrieved from the local storage. Afterwards it is checked, if dark-theme is applied.
If yes the elements which need to be styled are retrieved from the DOM (document.getElementById(...)). For example the path element is
requested by its id ("wavepath"). After that the color of the element is changed (document.getElementById("wavepath").style.fill = "rgb(13,23,33)").
