In this exercise we will analyze the following website:
https://www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/before/home.html

-) Accessability problems:
1) The navigation order (when using a keyboard) doesn't make sense.
2) The author of the website didn't make use of semantic html (no use of header, article, section, footer, etc.). 
Instead div's are used as containers for header, footer, etc..
3) Some color contrasts don't rely to the given standard (contrast-ratio).
4) There are some anchors on the page with the text "Click here".
5) Missing alt-attribute on images.
6) No additional layout for mobile devices (site is displayed on a mobile device like on a desktop device).

-)Lighthouse analysis:
Lighthouse analysis (see ../lighthouse-report.pdf)

-)Possible improvements:
1) Change navigation order to fit a logical order (left to right, top to bottom)
2) Make use of semantic html. This means we use header for the top content of the page instead of a div.
This also goes for other parts (footer, main, section, article).
3) Change the color contrast of some parts of the website to satisfy the standard AA or AAA.
4) Replace "Click here" anchors with meaningful text (description where the links lead to).
5) Add alt-attribute to images (which describes what displayed on the image)
6) Make the website responsive (for example use grid or flexbox to add a better support for mobile devices)
7) Improve navigation on the website by simplifying the navigation (group similar items)
8) Increase the border size of focused items to help users to see the currently focused item
9) Use clearer instructions (e.g. select item -> select an item from the list)
10) Use other font which is easier to read and doesn't stress the eye so much during long reading sessions
