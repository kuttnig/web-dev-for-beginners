Compare some programming languages. What are some of the unique traits of JavaScript vs. Java? How about COBOL vs. Go?

JavaScript:
Interpreted language, which means each line gets translated at runtime by the interpreter. Support of first-class functions
, which means functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, can be assigned to variables, and can be returned by other functions.
Very popular within the web, but can be also run locally without the need of a browser by using technologies like node.js.
JS is a single-threaded language, which supports OOP, imperative and declarative styles.

Java:
In contrast to JavaScript, Java is a compiled language. The src-code gets compiled into Java-Byte-code which gets executed afterwards by the JRE.
Java is strongly typed (JS uses dynamically typing), this means if we want to define a variable we have to set a specific data type for it (e.g. int, String, double, ...).
Java is also an OO-language, which supports imperative styles. 

COBOL:
= Common Business Oriented Language. COBOL is a programming language designed for business use. COBOL is OO and uses an imperative style. COBOL is a
compiled language.

Go:
Go is a compiled statically typed language (like Java). Go is mainly used for server-side backend programming and cloud based programming. 

=> JS is the only out of these four languages, which is interpreted + uses dynamic typing.
