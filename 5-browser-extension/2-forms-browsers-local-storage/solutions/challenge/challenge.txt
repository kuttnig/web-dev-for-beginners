Fetch API
src: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API

This application-programming-interface provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network).
Fetch provides a definition for the "Request" and "Response" objects. For example  if we call the fetch() method - 
a promise is returned to the caller. If the response is available the promise is fulfilled and it resolves to an Response-Object
, which represents the response to the request. Like any other object we can refer to the properties of the object. For example we
could use response.ok to check if the response was successful. 
It also defines concepts such as the CORS semantics. (CORS = Cross-Origin-Policy)
To make a request and fetch a resource the fetch() function can be used. 

What makes an great API in your opinion?
In my opinion a great API should be easy to use (naming of methods, properties, etc.).
The API should also be well documented.
